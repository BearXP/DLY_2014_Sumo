Features:

ATmega128 MCU @ 16MHz
64KB Static RAM (using Samsung K6R1008C1D and 75373 Octal Latch, 128kBit Chip)
32K Oscillator for RTC
5V and 9V Regulation and Outputs (using 7809 and 7805)
5V Supply Monitoring (using ZM33064))
JTAG Programming Port
RS-232 Serial Interface (using MAX232 with DB9 Connector)
I2C Serial Interface (with Pull-Up's and Header)
Headers for 4-inputs to ADC
Headers for all pins PORTB and PORTE
Headers for 4-pins of PORTD

Planned:

Convert PORTB/E into FET Driven Outputs? OR Stepper Motor Driver Circuitry? (combination of L296 and L297N)
Is an FPGA Required?
Include Power Distribution on this board? (1.2x25 = 30V --> 24V --> 12V --> 9V --> 5V)

Not Concrete:

Routing Rules (current board is set to 10mil max clearance and track size, could probably be reduced to 6mil)
Size of Board (current board is 12cm x 6.5cm)
Some of the footprints will need to be created by hand as the ones currently are rough estimates provided by Protel library
