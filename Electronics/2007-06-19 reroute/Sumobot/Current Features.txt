Features:

ATmega2560 MCU @ 16MHz
64KB Static RAM (using Samsung K6R1008C1D and 75373 Octal Latch, 128kBit Chip)
32K Oscillator for RTC
5V and 9V Regulation and Outputs (using 7809 and 7805)
5V Supply Monitoring (using ZM33064))
JTAG Programming Port
RS-232 Serial Interface (using MAX232 with DB9 Connector)
I2C Serial Interface (with Pull-Up's and Header)
Headers for 4-inputs to ADC
Headers for all pins PORTB, PORTE and PORTL
Headers for 4-pins of PORTD

Planned:

Breakout of Ports H, J and K
Replacing the 75373 with an FPGA to make PCB wiring a lot more maintainable, plus it supplies more I/O

Not Concrete:

Routing Rules (current board is set to 6mil max clearance and track size)
Size of Board (current board is approx 12cm x 8.5cm with two quadrants sparsely populated)
Some of the footprints will need to be created by hand as the ones currently are rough estimates provided by Protel library

Note that 6mil track size is sufficient for wiring nets to be routed through gaps in 1.27mm pitch contacts. Is this desired?
